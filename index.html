          A multi-talented tech enthusiast, educator, and creative mind behind

          <br />
          From reviewing the latest gadgets on YouTube to building platforms

          <ul>
            <li>
              Founder of Eleyoungtech Industries, managing sub-brands like
              Codeleyoungtech, Eleyoungmart, Giggliously (for comedy content),
              and Eduniac (for academic support)
            </li>
            <li>Programmer/Web Developer, currently mastering HTML, CSS.</li>
            <li>
              Developing Graphics and Logo Designer , with a focus on branding
              and visual identity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Public Speaking Coach and Book Author-in-Progress on effective

        <p class="about-body-des">
          I'm passionate about helping people grow â€” whether it's through
          affordable data services, digital training, or motivational programs
          like Weekly Recognition and Surprise Gifts. With a heart for
          creativity and a mission to make tech and learning accessible, I live
          by the motto: Creativity at its peak.

        <div class="more-about-wrapper-b">
          <p>
            To build a world where creativity meets technology, and young minds
            are empowered to unlock their full potential. I envision a future
            where access to digital skills, innovation, and expression isnâ€™t a
            privilege â€” itâ€™s a standard. Through platforms like Eleyoungtech,
            Codeleyoungtech, Eynet, and Giggliously, I aim to bridge gaps and
            spark greatness â€” one design, one video, one code, and one idea at a
            time.
          </p>

      <div class="more-about-wrapper">
        <div class="more-about-wrapper-h">My Mission</div>
        <div class="more-about-wrapper-b">
          <p>
            To inspire, educate, and elevate. My mission is to use my gifts in
            tech, design, content creation, and teaching to impact lives â€”
            practically and purposefully. Whether it's through reviewing gadgets
            that matter, designing visuals that communicate deeply, building
            tech platforms that solve real problems, or creating content that
            entertains and informs â€” I do it all with intention.
          </p>

          <p>
            Iâ€™m here to: Make technology easier to understand. Make creativity
            more accessible. Make people believe in their ability to grow And
            build communities that support, learn, and rise together
          </p>

          <p>
            Every project I touch, every platform I build, and every person I
            teach â€” it's all driven by one core belief: You donâ€™t need to be
            perfect to make impact â€” you just need to start.
          </p>

        <div class="more-about-wrapper-b">
          <p>
            I once taught students and still teach with passion. I run multiple
            brands â€” like Eleyoungtech, Eleyoungmart, Giggliously, and
            Codeleyoungtech â€” all born from a mix of curiosity, hustle, and love
            for making things happen. I can explain complex tech like youâ€™re 5,
            run a full class without notes, and build websites without coffee
            (but Iâ€™d still take some, thanks). I'm 101% sure creativity was
            Godâ€™s idea for solving boredom.
          </p>

          <p>
            I love inspiring others â€” not just to dream, but to do. If you're
            into tech, storytelling, memes, designs, or growing with purpose â€”
            you're in the right place.
